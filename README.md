This is Franks Github.

### Me stuff

- 👨‍🏫 Currently working for [TechEducators](https://techeducators.co.uk/) as a Software Teaching Assistant & Location Lead.
- 🤩 Fun fact: In one adventure, I rode a Bajaj Avenger motorbike around India for a good 6 months.
- 🔨 I love to understand things *(sometimes to a fault)*, and have been disassembling and repairing things since knee height.
- 🏔️ I've been an Outdoor Activity Instructor, Parkour Coach, Forest School Leader, Gardener and worn a whole bunch of other hats.
- 🗣️ Combine those two and you'd be right to think that I love to help others learn new things and build their skills.
- 🙌 Fun fact 2: I've been practising Parkour for over 17 years.
- ⛅️ Born and raised in the UK, but prefer warmer, sunnier climes.

### Codey stuff

- 🧑‍💻 Studied Computing in college, then picked up Coding again many years later on a [Software Development Bootcamp](https://techeducators.co.uk/course/software-development-bootcamp).
- 💥 Enjoyed making this [Ainsley Harriot-themed Cookie Clicker](https://ainsley-clicksiott-ready-steady-click.vercel.app/) - [Repo here](https://github.com/frank-ventures/teched-week06-project).
- 🖼️ ..and this [Unsplash Gallery Search App](https://frank-ventures.github.io/teched-week03-project/) - [Repo here](https://github.com/frank-ventures/teched-week03-project).
- 🕹️ I'm steadily piecing together a [GameLog App](https://github.com/frank-ventures/GameLog), and wrestling with doing things well!
- 💬 I'm also building a clone of the board game Articulate, called [DarkTiculate](https://darkticulate.vercel.app/) with my pal [Lewis Adams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewiswadams/). Be warned, the prompts range from "That's uncomfortable" to "Downright nasty"!
- Experience in: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NextJs, Node.js, NPM, Express, SQL, Linux OS's, Raspberry Pi's, Command Line, Notion, Excel Googling how to do things in all of those things...
